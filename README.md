# Deep Learning & NLP Training Repository

This repository contains the work I completed during my **III Year – II Semester training**, focused on **Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative AI fundamentals**.

The purpose of this repository is to document my hands-on learning, experiments, and mini-implementations while building a strong foundation in modern AI concepts.

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

The content in this repository is centered around:

- Core **Deep Learning concepts**
- **Neural Networks** and training intuition
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** fundamentals
- Introduction to **Generative AI**
- Practical coding exercises and small implementations
- Understanding pretrained models and pipelines

This is a **learning-focused repository**, emphasizing clarity, correctness, and conceptual understanding rather than production-scale systems.
